                     A chubby cat, sensitively rendered in soft 
                     <br> brushstrokes of ink in varying tones, is 
                     <br>blissfully resting. We see the feline from the 
                     <br> front, with its front legs tucked beneath, so 
                     <br>that its body forms nearly a perfect circle, 
                     <br>with the rear haunches symmetrically protruding
                     <br> from each side. The background is completely
                     <br> blank, with the exception of the three columns <br>of gracefully brushed calligraphy of the artist’s 
                     <br>own poem, accompanied by the artist’s signature <br>and anchored by a square red seal. The overall 
                     <br>effect is one of serenity, yet at the same time <br>humor and playfulness.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  The artist’s own witty poem—a kyōka (literally, “ 
                  <br>madcap verse”)—makes us reinterpret the image:

                  </p>

                     <br>Deep asleep the cat lies
                     <br>as if amid “deep grasses”
                     <br>of peony blossoms,
                     <br>perhaps having a dream
                     <br>in which he is a butterfly!

                     <br>—Trans. John T. Carpenter

               <div class= paragraph8>
                 <p>
                   The poem alludes to the famous episode of “Zhuang Zhou
                   <br> dreaming he is a butterfly” from the second 
                   <br>chapter (Of the Equality of Things) of the Daoist 
                   <br>classic Zhuangzi. Instead of portraying the 
                   <br>philosopher Zhuang Zhou (the proper name of 
                   <br>Zhuangzi) slumped over in sleep, as sometimes 
                   <br>depicted by Japanese artists, the artist Shinkai 
                   <br>has depicted a rotund cat fast asleep. The kyōka 
                   <br> poem includes wordplay by making fukami-gusa a pivot
                  <br>word (kakekotoba) first read as part of the 
                   <br>phrase nemuri no fukami (fast asleep) and then
                   <br> read as the poetic term fukami-gusa (deep 
                   <br>grasses), which is an alternative name for
                   <br>peonies. Cleverly, through verbal allusion, the
                   <br>painter-poet conjures up a picture of peonies and
                   <br>butterflies—a favorite theme of East Asian painting.

                     The artist Hōzōbō Shinkai was a Buddhist monk 
                     <br>active in the early Edo period, whose name 
                     <br>derives from the type of “monk’s dwelling” 
                     <br>(hōzōbō) in certain Kyoto Shingon temples 
                     <br>affiliated with the Otokoyama Hachiman Shrine.
                     <br>He studied tea ceremony under Kobori Enshū and
                     <br>is said to have studied calligraphy under the 
                     <br>tutelage of Shōkadō Shōjō, one of the top 
                     <br>calligraphy masters of the era when Shinkai was
                     <br>growing up. He studied haikai poetry with 
                     <br>Matsunaga Teitoku, who inspired him to create 
                     <br>of playful forms of kyōka, as represented by
                     <br>the poem here.
